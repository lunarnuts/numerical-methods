Numerical methods in Finiancial Computing.
My solutions for tasks in IE525 course. Please don't copy my work in your assignments, it will result in you getting 0 and getting filed an academic misconduct, which might result in expulsion. If you have questions, try contacting me n.kuandyk1995@gmail.com. Thanks.

### Assignment 1
project in this folder implements standard Monte-Carlo simulation with Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate call price of European Vanilla Call option(part2) and compares efficiency and accuracy with respect to variance reduction technique called Antithetic Variates Monte Carlo method.

### Assignment 2
project in this folder compares Standard Monte-Carlo with respect to Control Variates and Importance Sampling variance reduction techniques.

### Assignment 3
project in this folder implements Finite Difference Method to estimate price of Double Barrier Knock-Out European Call option.

### Project
project in this folder implements Quasi-Monte-Carlo methods with Sobol sequences to reduce variance and increase effieciency.
